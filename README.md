Sketch using the Mindflex EEG headset to light up a series of LEDs with you concentration level.

Go to http://frontiernerds.com/brain-hack to learn how to hack the Mindlex. Once you have your 2 wires from the ground and tx of the mindlex we can do interesting things with it. 

Now that we have the wires build this circuit and run this sketch on your arduino. Put the headset on and open the serial port. 

One thing to note is leave the RX pin out while you upload to the board. The Arduino uses the TX and RX with the computer while uploading so if there is something connected to on of those pins you will get an error.

You should start seeing values that relate to your attention. The level will correspond with an LED. But this is just the start. Now that you can light up an LED you can do anything. Have fun!!!
